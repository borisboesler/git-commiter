# git-commiter

Populate a GIT repository with commit messages.

## Purpose of `git-committer`

`git-committer` creates [git] commands to fill a *git-repository* with
variations of commit messages to test git changelog creators. Review
[How to Write Good Commit Messages: A Practical Git
Guide][freecodecamp:git], [keep a changelog][keepachangelog] and [A
Note About Git Commit Messages][tbaggery] as a guideline on how to
write commit messages.


## Supported Entries

`git-committer` creates [git] commands to generate different entries
in the commit messages. Supported types are:

- *Subject*: The main topic of this commit message.
- *Body*: A description, which might contain
    * *Mentions*: A reference to another person.
- *Co-authors*: A list of additional contributers.
- *Signed off*: Well.
- *Closes*: References to bug identifiers.
- *Breaking Change*:


## Configure, Build and Install

To configure `git-commiter` create a build directory change to it and
run `cmake`:

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ../

To compile run `make`:

	make

To install it set an installation prefix during configuration, eg:

	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD/install ../
	make install


## Test

The git-changelog creator [git-chglog] is supported. The commit
messages in branch `testcommits/base` were generated by this tool
`git-commiter` and the file `CHANGELOG.md` was created.
